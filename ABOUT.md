# About this fork

This is a fork of the [Snicker](https://github.com/bludit-plugins/snicker) plugin.

## Why this fork exist

I was happy with how the plugin worked. I was not happy with how the plugin looked. And I found it a bit unlogical here and there.

## Goals

- change the appearance to match the rest of the ui
- make the ui more logical
- make the plugin easier to use

## Disclaimer

This is beta software, as long as this disclaimer exist. There will be bugs.
